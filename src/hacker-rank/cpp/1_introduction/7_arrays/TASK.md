# Arrays

### Task

You will be given an array of integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.

### Input Format

The first line of the input contains $N$,where $N$ is the number of integers. The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers.

### Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq A[i] \leq 10000$, where $A[i]$ is the $i^{th}$ integer in the array.

### Output Format

Print the $N$ integers of the array in the reverse order, space-separated on a single line.

### Sample Input

```
4
1 4 3 2
```

### Sample Output

```
2 3 4 1
```

**Note:** Unlike C, C++ allows dynamic allocation of arrays at runtime without special calls like malloc(). If $n=10$, `int arr[n]` will create an array with space for $10$ integers.
