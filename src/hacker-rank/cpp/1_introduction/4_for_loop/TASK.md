# For Loop

### Task

In this challenge, you will use a for loop to increment a variable through a range.

### Input Format

You will be given two positive integers, $a$ and $b$ with $(a \leq b)$, separated by a newline.

### Output Format

For each integer $n$ in the inclusive interval $[a, b]$:

- If $1 \leq n  \leq 9$, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is `one` for $\$, `two` for $2$, and so on.
- Else if $n > 9$ and it is an even number, then print `even`.
- Else if $n > 9$ and it is an odd number, then print `odd`.

**Note**: $[a,b] = \{x \in Z | a \leq x \leq b\} = \{a, a+1, ..., b\}$

### Sample Input

```
8
11
```

### Sample Output

```
eight
nine
even
odd
```
