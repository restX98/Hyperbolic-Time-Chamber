# Hyperbolic Time Chamber

The Hyperbolic Time Chamber (精神と時の部屋 Seishin to Toki no Heya, lit. "Room of Spirit and Time") is a mysterious dimension that exists outside of Universe 7, but can be accessed from the universe via different doorways. Each chamber has a time-compressed nature, making the flow of time vastly different compared to the flow of time outside of the chamber.
